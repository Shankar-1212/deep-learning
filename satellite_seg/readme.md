# Satellite Segmentation Project
----
This project focuses on satellite image segmentation using a multi-UNet model architecture. Below are the details of the model and the results of our experiments.
## Model Architecture
- **Multi-UNet**
The multi-UNet model was trained and validated on a satellite image dataset. The process involved loading the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance using various metrics.

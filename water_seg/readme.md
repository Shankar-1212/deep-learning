# Water Segmentation Project
----
This project focuses on segmenting water bodies using the DeepLabV3+ model architecture. Below are the details of the model and the results of our experiments.
## Model Architecture
- **DeepLabV3+**
The DeepLabV3+ model was trained on a dataset of water bodies. The process involved loading the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance over several epochs.

## Results
